          <div class="py-1" data-v-a07f78b4="">

          <h4 data-v-a07f78b4="">5.2 Use of cookies</h4>
          <p data-v-a07f78b4=""> Our website uses cookies. These are small files that your browser automatically creates and that are stored on your end device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when you visit our website. Cookies do not cause any damage to your end device and do not contain any viruses, Trojans or other malware. We use cookies to make our website more user-friendly. The data collected by these cookies is not used to create user profiles. </p>
          <p data-v-a07f78b4=""> We use so-called session cookies to recognize that you have already visited individual pages of our website. These cookies contain a characteristic string of characters that enables the browser and the associated session settings to be uniquely identified when the website is called up again. They are automatically deleted after you leave our site or when you end your session. </p>
          <p data-v-a07f78b4=""> In addition, we use cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection cookies to increase the security of our website, which are stored on your end device for a specified period of time. </p>
          <p data-v-a07f78b4=""> Cookies are stored on the user's computer and transmitted by it to our website. As a user, you therefore have full control over the use of cookies. You can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing the settings in your Internet browser. Cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are deactivated for our website, it may no longer be possible to use all functions of the website to their full extent. </p>
          <h4 data-v-a07f78b4="">5.3 Web analysis using Matomo</h4>
          <p data-v-a07f78b4=""> We use cookies to statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate it for the purpose of optimizing our offer for you. This subsection explains how we use the open source software Matomo for web analysis in order to collect anonymized usage statistics. </p>
          <h5 data-v-a07f78b4="">5.3.1 What data is collected</h5>
          <div class="py-1" data-v-a07f78b4="">
            When using Matomo, we collect the following anonymized data:
            <ul data-v-a07f78b4="">
              <li data-v-a07f78b4="">Your IP address (in anonymized form)</li>
              <li data-v-a07f78b4="">The pages accessed and their sequence</li>
              <li data-v-a07f78b4="">The time spent on the individual pages</li>
              <li data-v-a07f78b4="">The browser type and version used</li>
              <li data-v-a07f78b4="">The operating system</li>
              <li data-v-a07f78b4="">The country of origin</li>
              <li data-v-a07f78b4="">Date and time of access</li>
              <li data-v-a07f78b4="">Referring pages from which you accessed our website (referrer)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h5 data-v-a07f78b4="">5.3.2 Anonymization of the data</h5>
          <p data-v-a07f78b4=""> Your IP address is immediately anonymized by Matomo so that no conclusions can be drawn about your person. This is done by shortening the IP address by the last two bytes (example: 192.168.100.123 becomes 192.168.0.0). As a result, all data collected remains completely anonymous and cannot be traced back to you. </p>
          <h5 data-v-a07f78b4="">5.3.3 Intended use of the data</h5>
          <p data-v-a07f78b4=""> We use Matomo exclusively to collect and analyze anonymized information about the use of our website in order to measure its reach. Our focus here is on statistically recording and continuously improving the use of our website. Furthermore, lists and summaries of usage statistics derived from this are reported to the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), as the web content offered is a service provided as part of a BMBF-funded third-party project. The data is collected on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. In doing so, we are pursuing our legitimate interest in optimizing our website and reporting to funding bodies. </p>
          <h5 data-v-a07f78b4="">5.3.4 Storage and deletion of data</h5>
          <p data-v-a07f78b4=""> The Matomo instance we use is provided by the Center for Biotechnology - CeBiTec at Bielefeld University as a service within the framework of the de.NBI project. The collected and anonymized data are stored on CeBiTec's servers and are not passed on to third parties or merged with other data sources. They are only stored for as long as is necessary to achieve the above-mentioned purposes. The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the aforementioned purposes. </p>
          <h5 data-v-a07f78b4="">5.3.5 Matomo Cookies</h5>
          <p data-v-a07f78b4=""> Cookies are used to enable anonymous recognition of a user by the web analysis software Matomo. The "_pk_id" cookie contains an anonymous unique user ID with a validity of 13 months, the "_pk_ref" cookie contains the referrer originally used to visit the website with a lifespan of 6 months and the "_pk_ses" cookie, which is a short-lived cookie with a lifespan of 30 minutes that temporarily stores the data of the website visit. Expiring cookies are then deleted by your browser. The validity is renewed when you visit the website again. Cross-site or cross-domain tracking does not take place; the cookies are used exclusively in the context of this website and to fulfill the above-mentioned purposes. </p>
          <h5 data-v-a07f78b4="">5.3.6 Your rights and option to object</h5>
          <p data-v-a07f78b4=""> As we do not collect any personal data using Matomo, you cannot assert any rights against us with regard to information, correction, blocking or deletion of this data. However, you have the option of objecting to the collection by Matomo at any time by blocking the cockies. Furthermore, you can anonymize your data by using your browser in anonymous/private mode. </p>
